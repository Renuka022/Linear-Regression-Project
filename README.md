# Linear-Regression-Project
### Project Title : To predict the Heart attach disease for organisation WHO(World Health Organisation),using Machine Learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease will increasing manner or decreasing manner.
### Problem Statement :
## The world health Organisation (WHO) estimated 12 million then records One of them half of the dead result is found in US.The research scholor point out the most relevent risk factor as a Datascience engineering predict the overall risk using Machine Learning algorith called as Logistic Regression.
Task 1
Import the libraries which is required for prediction
Task 2
Import the Dataset using your workspace.
Task 3
Use a appropriate argument of sk learn library to train,test and split the datasets.
Task 4
Fit your values with arrange function using feature scalling.
Task 5
check your model accuracy and precision using confussion matrics.

### Conclusion:
According to the model analysis the LogesticReggresion algorith works succesfully with range[0.6]accuracy.
The accuracy shows that building the model is successfull.
